A 3D voxel game with cubed chunks.
The world is dark with no sun except snake-like wisps hovering throughout the casms.

Story:
The world is falling apart, wisps are the only glue that holds it together.
Creativity was lost when the Dregs (pre-historic humans) wiped eachother out.
Ever since then, the world has been pulling itself apart.
